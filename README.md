GyroscopeExplorer
=================

Android application example of implementing a gyroscope.

Explore usage of the Android devices gyroscope sensor. Gyroscope Explorer contains Android classes that demonstrate how to use the Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE and Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED. This includes integrating the sensor outputs over time to describe the devices change in angles, initializing the rotation matrix, concatination of the new rotation matrix with the initial rotation matrix and providing an orientation for the concatenated rotation matrix. The Android developer documentation covers some of this information, but it is an incomplete example that is fully implemented within Gyroscope Explorer. Gyroscope Explorer provides the Earth frame orientation with the azimuth, pitch and roll and described in a clean graphical view.
